# Communication and Concurrency

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th Year [Communication and Concurrency](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/coc) course, taken in 2011/2012. There were two pieces of coursework during the COC course, both of which focused around modelling concurrent processes using the [Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/perdita/cwb/). Unfortunately the coursework reports were hand-written, and so only the few workbench files are stored here.

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
